# Network Performance Optimization Project

## Description

The Network Performance Optimization project aims to enhance the network performance of XYZ Company's local area network (LAN) by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks. By leveraging industry-leading network monitoring tools, optimizing network configurations, and implementing appropriate solutions, this project aims to improve network efficiency, reduce latency, and enhance overall network performance.

## Key Features

- Network Traffic Analysis: Utilize tools such as Wireshark and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor to analyze network traffic patterns and identify areas of congestion and performance degradation.
- Bottleneck Identification: Use tools like Cisco Network Assistant and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor to identify network components or configurations causing performance bottlenecks.
- Performance Optimization: Implement solutions to optimize network performance, such as upgrading network hardware, adjusting network configurations using Cisco IOS, or optimizing network protocols like BGP or OSPF.
- Monitoring and Metrics: Set up tools such as PRTG Network Monitor or SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor to track performance metrics, measure the impact of optimization efforts, and ensure ongoing network performance monitoring.
- Documentation and Lessons Learned: Document the steps taken, improvements achieved, and lessons learned throughout the project using tools like Confluence or Microsoft Word.

## Project Deliverables

1. Network Performance Assessment: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of XYZ Company's LAN performance using Wireshark and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, including network traffic analysis, latency measurements, and identification of performance bottlenecks.
2. Optimization Plan: Develop a detailed optimization plan using Cisco Network Assistant, including recommended solutions and strategies to address the identified network performance issues.
3. Implementation: Execute the optimization plan, making necessary network configuration changes using Cisco IOS, upgrading network hardware components, or optimizing network protocols.
4. Performance Metrics and Monitoring: Set up PRTG Network Monitor or SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor to track performance metrics before and after optimization efforts. Document the performance improvements achieved.
5. Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation throughout the project using Confluence or Microsoft Word, including network assessment findings, optimization plan, implementation steps, performance metrics, and lessons learned.
6. Lessons Learned Report: Summarize the lessons learned from the project, including best practices, challenges faced, and recommendations for future network optimization initiatives.
